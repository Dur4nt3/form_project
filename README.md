# Sign-up Form Project (The Odin Project)

### Sign-Up Form | The Odin Project | Intermediate HTML and CSS

This is the first project within the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" course of the "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to create a sign-up form given a design.

You can view the original design given [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png).

This project is a different project than the "Sign-Up Form Design" project; that project *(unlike this one)* was **not** created from a given design, rather it was a design I created myself.

You can find the "Sign-Up Form Design" [here](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/signup_project).

Both project share similarities, yet they have their own unique features.

*Unlike the aforementioned project, this project doesn't include form validation via JavaScript as it's a concept that will be introduced at a later stage.*

**Skills demonstrated: Creating forms from a given design, basic HTML forms, HTML form validation**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PROJECT WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON MOBILE DEVICES**
