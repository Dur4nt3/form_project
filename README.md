# Sign-up Form Project (The Odin Project)

### Sign-Up Form | The Odin Project | Intermediate HTML and CSS

This is the first project within the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" course of the "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to create a sign-up form given a design.

You can view the original design given [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png).

This project is a different project than the "Sign-Up Form Design" project; that project *(unlike this one)* was **not** created from a given design, rather it was a design I created myself.

You can find the "Sign-Up Form Design" [here](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/signup_project).

Both project share similarities, yet they have their own unique features.

**Skills demonstrated: Intermediate HTML, Intermediate CSS, basic JavaScript**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PROJECT WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON A MOBILE PHONE**

### Notes:

At this stage, I've been asked to NOT use JavaScript to validate the form, this means that there is no custom design for invalid form submissions and most importantly no validation that the passwords actually match or are secure (apart from a basic 10 character minimum requirement).

*In contrast to this project* in my "Sign-Up Form Design" project I've implemented custom JavaScript validation, you can view that project [here](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/signup_project). [^1]

[^1]: Although I can reuse the JavaScript I've used in my "Sign-Up Form Design" project, I've opted not to do so as I want to implement JavaScript form validation in this project only after I took a deep-dive into that subject, and see the difference between my initial attempt to implement JavaScript form validation and my second attempt after taking a deep-dive into the subject.
